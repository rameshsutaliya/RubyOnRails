In Ruby, All Data Type based on classes because it is a pure Object-Oriented language.
Data Types in Ruby:-
  Numbers
  Boolean
  Strings
  Hashes
  Arrays
  Symbols.

1. Number: Integers & floating point.
  Example:-
    #float
      price = 10.45
    # Integers & float.
      tax = 10.45*12/100

      puts "total price of A is #{price+tax} $"

2. Boolean: true & false
  Example:-
    if true
      puts "I'm True!"
    else
      puts "I'm False!!"
    end

3. Strings: A group of characters/letters. Strings in ruby are defined by enclosing a text within a single Quotes or double Quotes.
    Example:-
      Name = "Ramesh"
      intro = "I'm Ramesh"

4. Hashes: Hash is a key value pair. Where the value to a key will be assigned by using => sign. Hash is same as Dictionary in Python. or A key pair is separated
with a comma between them and all the pairs are enclosed within curly braces.
  Example:-
    rollOneMarks = {"English" => 95, "Hindi" => 86, "Mathematics" => 100, "Science" => 98, "SocialScience" => 96, "Computer" => 98}
    #printing data with Subject
    rollOneMarks.each do |subject, makrs|
      print subject, ": ", marks, "\n"
    end

5. Arrays:- It stores data or list of Data (any Types). separated by comma and enclosed by square bracket.
  Example:-
    array = ["Ramesh", "Learning Ruby", 7]
    array1 = ["Ramesh", "Learning Ruby", 7,]
    array.each do |item|
      puts item
    end

    array and array1 are same, In array1 the last comma will be ignored.

6. Symbols:- "light-weight Strings". A Symbol is preceded by a colon(:).
  Example:-
    names = {:rs => "Ramesh Sutaliya", :ms => "Mohan Singh" }

    puts names[:rs]
    puts name[:ms]
