=begin
Private methods: are methods defined under the private keyword/method. Private methods can only be
used within the class definition; theyâ€™re for internal usage. The only way to have external access
to a private method is to call it within a public method. Also, private methods can not be called
with an explicit receiver, the receiver is always implicitly self. Think of private methods as
internal helper methods.
=end
#dog.usePrivate #protected also not accessable by the class object.
class Dog
  def enter_Data
    Animal.usePrivate
  end
  def show_data
    Animal.new.showData
  end
end
dog = Dog.new
dog.enter_Data
dog.show_data

human = Animal.new
human.showData
