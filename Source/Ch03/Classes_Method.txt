  By default all the methods in the class will be public.

  Private Methods:-
    class Example
      def pubMethod
        puts "Public method"
      end

      private
      def method2
        puts "This is private Method"
      end
    end

    Method initialize(): this method is used as constructor. This method will be called when object of the class gets created. This is by default a private method.

    Example:->
      class Class_Name
        #constructor
        def initialize
          puts "Object has been created"
        end
      end

    obj = Class_Name.new
    it will print the message: Object has been created.
